# Plants-Diseases-Detection
The project is related to the classification of plant diseases. For this purpose, the publicly available PlantVillage dataset was used. In the Dataset folder, you can find a version of this dataset divided by the author into a training, validation and test set which constitute 80%, 10% and 10% of all available data, respectively. The following files contain the used classification models:
- Basic_machine_learning_techniques.ipynb: contains implementations of two simple image classification techniques proposed by the author (simple Artificial Neural Network amd shallow Convolutional Neural Network).
- Advanced_CNN_from_scartch.ipynb: contains implementations of thge considered advanced CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, Inception-V3, Xception, denseNet201) from scratch.
- Advanced_CNN_transfer_learning.ipynb: contains all the advanced CNN architectures mentioned above, trained using transfer learning (models pre-trained on ImageNet dataset available in Keras API are used).
